/* Encapsulation is wrapping up of data and member function in a single unit called class.*/

//Example:-
/*class Account {
private:
    double balance;
    string password;    // data hiding

public:
    //properties | attributes
    string accountId;
    string username;
    
    //methods | member function

};*/

//Encapsulation helps in data hiding.
//Data Hiding -> it means hide the sensitive information. How? -> (by making private access modifier or Protected).

/* So, Encapsulation is basically creating a class and 
   inside the class declaring the data/properties + member function. */
